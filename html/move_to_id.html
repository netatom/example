	<p>Why hushed you, O, gaiety’s voice?
	Resound, the hymns of the Bacchus!
	Long live they, who ever had loved us --
	The beautiful women and sweet, gentle girls!
	Let glasses be full with wines’ gold!
	To bottom, that rings,
	The sacred gold rings
	Let fall through the wine, sweet and cold.
	Raise higher your glasses and move them right now!
	Long live airy muses, and brightness of brow!
	You, hallowed sun, flare on!
	Like this icon-lamp is a-paling
	In light of the growing dawn,
	So all false sagacity’s dimming and failing
	By great endless sun of the mind.
	Long live holy sun, and let dark die behind.
	The land of Moscow -- the land that is my native,
	Where in the dawn of my best years,
	I spared the hours of carelessness, attractive,
	Free of unhappiness and fears.
	And you had seen the foes of my great nation,
	And you were burned and covered with blood!
	And I did not give up my life in immolation,
	My wrathful spirit just was wild!...

	Where is the Moscow of hundred golden domes,
	The dear beauty of the native land?
	Where yore was the real peer to Rome,
	The ruins, miserable, lied.
	Oh, how, Moscow, for us, your sight, is awful!
	The buildings of landlords and kings are fully swept,
	All perished in a flame. The towers are mournful,
	The villas of the rich are felled.

	And where the luxury was thriving,
	In shady parks and gardens, in the past,
	Where myrtle was fragrant, limes were shining,
	There now are just coals, ash, and dust.
	At charming summer nights, when silent darkness roves,
	The noisy gaiety would not appear there,
	The lights are vanished over lakes and groves,
	All dead and silent. All unfair.

	Be calm, o, Russia's banner's holder,
	Look at the stranger's quickly coming end,
	On their proud necks and void of labor shoulders,
	The Lord's vindictive arm is laid.
	Behold: they promptly run, without look at road,
	In Russian snows their blood like river's flood,
	They run in dark of night, felled by famine and cold,
	And swords of Russians, from behind.
	The saddened crescent, in the morning skies,
	Meets the young dawn full of the utter gladness,
	One is in flames, another cold like ice.
	The dawn shines like a bride, the young and blameless,
	By her a crescent in the deathly paleness –
	Dear Elvina, thus I’ve met you once.</p>
